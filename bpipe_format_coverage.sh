# Writes final BEDTools coverage stats
#       to stdout (redirected by bpipe
#       to *.summary file).
#
# Args:
#   IN: Output file from BEDTools coverageBed -hist,
#       which is created by bpipe mutation calling pipelines.
#   FASTQ1: Forward reads' FASTQ file of the same sample to
#       which IN belongs. Required to calculate the total
#       number of sequenced bases, which in turn is required
#       to obtain the proportion of on-target bases.
#   FASTQ2: Reverse reads' FASTQ file of the same sample to
#       which IN belongs.
#   [...]: Coverage thresholds of interest (int). For each of these,
#       the proportion of the target reference covered on average by
#       at least that many reads is calculated and written to stdout.
