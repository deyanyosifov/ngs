"""
Demultiplex FASTQ files by extracting all those reads whose
index matches a given sequence and saving these to separate
FASTQ files. At most one mismatch is allowed within each
extracted index sequence.

Args:
    - Paired FASTQ files containing actual read sequences (_R1, _R2).
    - Paired FASTQ files containing index sequences to be used
        for demultiplexing (_I1, _I2)
    - The index sequences to extract. These must be contained within
        the I1 and I2 index files, respectively. For Illumina, the i7
        index will be contained within I1 and should be provided before
        the i5 index, which will be contained within I2.

Output:
    - Paired read and index FASTQ files (_R1, _R2, _I1, _I2)
        containing all those reads from the input FASTQ files
        that could be mapped to the input index sequence.
        Output files names correspond to a concatenation of
        the input FASTQ file prefix and the index sequences
        whose reads were extracted.
