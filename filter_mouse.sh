# Filter the mutations output by our bpipe
#       pipelines and annotate them with
#       flanking reference sequence of a
#       given length.
#
# Args:
#   IN: Input CSV file to be filtered and
#       annotated, as output by our pipelines.
#   OUT: Output prefix for filtered and
#       annotated files.
#   CANDIDATES: List of candidate genes,
#       quoted, one per line.
#   REF: Reference genome used during alignment
#       and variant calling. This is only used
#       when variants are annotated offline.
#       (Currently variants are annotated online
#       but the parameter has to be passed for
#       compatibility reasons, since all parameters
#       are positional.
#   FLANKING_SEQ_LEN: Number of bases of reference
#       flanking sequence to annotate on either
#       side of the variants.
#
# Output:
#   $OUT_*filtered*csv: Filtered CSV files at various steps
#       of filtering.
#   $OUT_filter_statistics.txt: Stats on the number of
#       mutations filtered and retained at each step.
#       of the collected and merged statistics.
#   $OUT_candidates.txt: Separate file with variants
#       affecting the provided candidate genes of interest.
