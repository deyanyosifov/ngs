# Calculate the average on-target coverage per gene
#
# Args:
#   BED: Name of / Path to the target BED file
#        which was also passed to bpipe to
#        generate the *coverBED.txt files. Column 4
#        should contain feature IDs (gene names) for
#        which the average coverage is then calculated.
#
#   ...: For each sample, for which the average
#        per-gene coverage is to be calculated,
#        pass the respective *coverBED.txt file
#        generated by bpipe via BEDTools' coverage command. 
#        Column 5 should be the depth of coverage,
#        column 8 should be the fraction of the respective
#        BED entry (amplicon) with that coverage.
#
# Output:
#   $DIR/average_coverage_summary.tsv: containing all
#       of the collected and merged statistics.
