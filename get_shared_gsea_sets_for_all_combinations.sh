# Based on a specified FDR cutoff, returns the significant gene sets
#       shared by one or more GSEA result tables.
#
# Args:
#   ALPHA: FDR cutoff for statistical significance of gene set
#       enrichment.
#   RANK: Ranking metric used for the GSEA preranked input gene lists.
#       Though previous versions supported various rankings, currently
#       gsea.sh will generate only those based on the log fold change.
#       For these analyses, pass 'lfc'.
#   [...]: All other inputs are GSEA result table *prefixes*. These
#       prefixes must make
#
#       ${PREFIX}*${GENE_SET_COLLECTION}*${RANKING_METRIC}*/gsea_report_*${CHANGE}*.xls
#
#       unique - they are used to collect all the GSEA result tables
#       from which shared significant gene sets are gathered.
#       For each combination of gene-set-collection, ranking-metric and
#       direction-of-enrichment (enrichment vs depletion), the
#       significant gene sets shared by files of *all* of the provided
#       file prefixes are returned and printed to stdout.
